		                                 RULES:
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		When playing Sagrada by yourself, you’re trying to beat a Target Score.
		The Target Score is the sum of the values from all the dice on the Round 
		Track at the end of the game.

		Gameplay
		Each game is played in 10 rounds:
		• Each round, roll 4 dice.
		• Take 2 turns, choosing to draft and place a die and/or use a Tool Card,
		or pass.

		Tool Cards
		• Tool Cards may be used only once by spending dice from the Draft Pool. 
		• To use a Tool Card place a die from the Draft Pool that matches the color 
		shown on the Tool Card.
		Note: Each Tool Card may only be used once. Both the die spent and the Tool
		Card are now removed from play.

		End Game Scoring
		The game ends after the end of 10th round. 
		• The Target Score is the sum of the values from all the dice on the
		Round Track. Dice used to pay for Tool Cards are not counted.
		• Your Victory Point total is the total of pips of the private objective 
		dice on your player board combined with the points scored from one of the 
		private objectives (note: each open space results in a 3 point reduction).
		• If your Victory Point total is greater than the Target Score, you win!
